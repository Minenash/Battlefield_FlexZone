# Battlefield FlexZone

This app allows students, teachers, and administrator to create, view, and accept or decline flex requests.

## What is Flex

Flex is a system adopted by Battlefield High School, that gives students and teachers time to do task
that would normally happen after school, go more in-depth in topics, or give extra time to do
assignments or projects. Teachers can not do normal instruction, nor can they hand out mandatory
assignments.

Flex is integrated by the school, by using a 4-block day.
- Purple Days: 2, Flex, 4, 6
- Black Days: 1, 3, 5, 7

The Flex Block is split into 2, Flex A and Flex B. The classes you go to for Flex A and Flex B are
rotated through under the following sequence:
- A: 1 & B: 2
- A: 3 & B: 6
- A: 4 & B: 7
- A: 1 & B: 2
- A: 3 & B: 6
- A: 5 & B: 7

## What are Flex Requests

You can leave your class during a flex block to goto another class, if you need to retake a test or
help with the teacher. This requires permission from both teachers. This app simplifies this by
allowing you to create and accept/deny the requests from your phone instead of needing finding them.
